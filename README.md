# cft
Charming Framework on Task

# Why?

1. Why not?
2. It's cool
3. We really need something better than what we have now

# Why like this?

Because UNIX philosophy rocks. Compounding small tools allow us to reduce the cognitive load of single components.
Think of it like your operative system, the learning curve is long but it's massively reliable.
We want our developer tooling to be massively reliable.

# What is this?

`cft` stands for Charming Framework on [Task](https://github.com/go-task/task). It also stands for [conformal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_field_theory) in quantum field theory. Is just cool as that.

# How to use it? 

Still no idea.

# Prerequisites

1. `task`
